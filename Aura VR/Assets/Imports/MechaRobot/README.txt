Hi fellow developer,

First of all, thank you very much for your purchase, you're the best! And all the best for you and your game project(s).
I'd be glad if you add my name in the credits of the game that used my lovingly-crafted 3d character. :)
Or email/twit me the game's website, Steam Greenlight page or whatever so I could help you guys. :)
