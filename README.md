# The Humber Games - Wind Turbines

## Description
The Humber Games is a collaboration between the University of Hull and Aura Innovation Centre.  It takes the form of an interactive Virtual Reality experience which was presented at the Global Offshore Wind 2019 conference at ExCeL London.

The game enables two players work together to build wind turbines along the Humber, one collecting parts in a boat whilst the other pilots a titan to construct each turbine.  Players must build as many turbines in the time provided, providing more renewable energy for cities and villages around the Humber, and surrounding area.
